The interface of ElectrosFI (Electromagnetic Simulator of the Federal Institute of São Paulo Campus Itapetininga) 
to the Meep (Finite-Difference Time-Domain) to simulate the results of Photonic Components. 

## Abstract:
The parameter's complexity and computational demand for modeling required in new photonic device design has significantly increased in last years. It has required that companies operating in telecommunications area include in their workframe specialists in numerical modeling and computational infrastructure to maintain the necessary park to attempt these demands. Furthermore, the financial cost demands frequent acquisition and maintenance in high-performance computing for data processing and store. This may unallowed for startups and/or small businesses to develop them. In this scenario this project intends to develop a Web environment focused on 2D photonic devices modeling following cloud computing concepts to offer a Software as a Service. Therefore, this project is henceforth justified by the development of a simple and practical interface for modeling these devices and simulations with numerical libraries available on the Internet such as the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) based method and other libraries based on Finite Element developed by some colleagues.
